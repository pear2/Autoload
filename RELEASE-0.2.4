- Add optional dynamically-generated class map so full file paths can be
  used when loading class files.
  
- Added a few test cases, along with non-Pyrus .phpt runner to keep us from
  trying to load PEAR2\Autoload twice!

- Removed PEAR2\ prefix requirement for loaded classes. Now psr-0 compliant.
